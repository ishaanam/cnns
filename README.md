This repository contains a convolutional neural network made wih Pytorch capable of determining if a cell is or is not infected with malaria based off of an image of the cell. This neural network has an accuracy of 87%.

I used this kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
