This repository contains a convolutional neural network capable of determining if a cell is or is not infected with malaria based off of an image of the cell. 
This neural network has an accuracy of 90%.

I used this kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
