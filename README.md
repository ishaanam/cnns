This repository contains a convolutional neural network made with Pytorch capable of determining if a cell is or is not infected with malaria based off of an image of the cell. This neural network has an accuracy of 87%.

I used this kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria 

This is where I learned how to code CNNs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh
